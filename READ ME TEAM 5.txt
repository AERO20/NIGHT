Hello team 5!

Congratulations on getting the code for this file!
Now you have to find FOUR coloured cards using your map. Your team is pink.

Communicate these grid references to your recon team (MRF16E2), one at a time.
Card 1: 027013
Card 2: 029042
Card 3: 087037
Card 4: 098028

Once you have all of these cards, you must arrange them like dominoes.
For example:

S12345A A12345B B12345C C12345E

This will give you a 20-number long code, for the example above it would be:
12345123451234512345
