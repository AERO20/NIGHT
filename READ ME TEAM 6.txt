Hello team 6!

Congratulations on getting the code for this file!
Now you have to find FOUR coloured cards using your map. Your team is light blue.

Communicate these grid references to your recon team (MRF16F2), one at a time.
Card 1: 029028
Card 2: 051032
Card 3: 067045
Card 4: 095045

Once you have all of these cards, you must arrange them like dominoes.
For example:

S12345A A12345B B12345C C12345E

This will give you a 20-number long code, for the example above it would be:
12345123451234512345
